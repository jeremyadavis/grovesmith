# Save Category - Goal-Setting & Delayed Gratification

## Philosophy

The Save category teaches children how to save up for desired purchases and experience the satisfaction of delayed gratification. Through structured goal-setting with wishlist items and visual progress tracking, children learn patience, planning, and the difference between wants and needs.

## Learning Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Delayed Gratification:** Learning to wait for meaningful purchases rather than impulsive spending
- **Goal Setting:** Establishing clear targets and working systematically toward them
- **Priority Management:** Choosing which items matter most when resources are limited
- **Progress Awareness:** Understanding how small contributions accumulate toward large goals
- **Purchase Satisfaction:** Greater appreciation for items they've saved toward

### Educational Philosophy
- **Structured Saving:** Clear targets prevent aimless accumulation
- **Visual Progress:** Progress bars and indicators maintain motivation
- **Wishlist Management:** Mandatory wish listing before saving teaches planning
