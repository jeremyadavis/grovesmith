## Educational Philosophy

Grovesmith emphasizes **learning through experience** rather than chore-based rewards:

- **Manager-Controlled:** Parents maintain oversight while children learn through guided experience
- **Real Consequences:** Financial decisions have actual outcomes within a safe learning environment  
- **Balanced Approach:** Equal emphasis on giving, spending, saving, and investing
- **Privacy-Respectful:** No surveillance of individual purchases or personal choices
- **Achievement-Based:** Recognition tied to genuine financial milestones and positive behaviors
