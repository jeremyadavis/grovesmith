# Grovesmith Product Overview

## Core Philosophy

Grovesmith is a financial literacy application designed to teach children responsible money management through structured allowance distribution. The app emphasizes **educational financial principles rather than chore-based rewards**, helping children learn to make thoughtful decisions with their money across four key financial categories.

## Target Users

- **Primary Users:** Managers (parents, guardians, sponsors) who control all financial operations
- **Secondary Users:** Recipients (children/learners) with view-only access to track their progress

## Educational Approach

### Allowance Formula

Weekly allowance = recipient's age � 2 in dollars

- Example: A 10-year-old receives $5.00 weekly
- Automatically adjusts as recipients age
- **Educational, not chore-based** - money is provided to teach financial concepts

### Core Learning Goals

1. **Purposeful Decision Making** - Children learn to think before spending
2. **Delayed Gratification** - Saving for meaningful goals builds patience and planning skills
3. **Balanced Financial Health** - Experience with all four financial categories creates well-rounded money habits
4. **Real-World Preparation** - Simulated experiences prepare them for adult financial decisions

## The Four Financial Categories

Each allowance distribution is split across four educational categories, each teaching different financial principles:

### 1. **Give** =�

_Teaching charitable giving and purposeful donations_

- Children select up to 3 specific causes they care about
- Build toward target donation amounts for chosen causes
- Learn empathy, research skills, and the satisfaction of helping others
- **Core Lesson:** Money can make a positive difference in the world

### 2. **Spend** =�

_Teaching transaction experience and impulse control_

- Untracked spending money for learning real-world purchases
- Children carry actual cash to practice checkout interactions
- No restrictions - freedom to make mistakes and learn from them
- **Core Lesson:** Experience handling money and understanding purchase decisions

### 3. **Save** <�

_Teaching goal-setting and delayed gratification_

- Structured saving toward specific wishlist items
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Multiple subcategories (Clothes, Books, Toys, Games, etc.)
- **Core Lesson:** Good things come to those who wait and plan

### 4. **Invest** =�

_Teaching investment principles and compounding growth_

- Simulated dividend payments at $0.05 per dollar (twice monthly on 1st & 15th)
- When reaching $50, money transitions to real UGMA/UTMA investment accounts
- Visual tracking of compound growth over time
- **Core Lesson:** Money can grow when invested wisely

## Key Design Principles

### Manager-Controlled System

- All financial decisions and distributions controlled by managers
- Recipients have view-only access to track progress
- Prevents accidental or unauthorized transactions
- Maintains educational focus rather than giving children full financial control

### Gamification Without Trivialization

- Achievement system rewards positive financial behaviors
- Personalized themes make each child's experience unique
- Trophies tied to real financial milestones, not arbitrary tasks
- **Balance:** Make learning fun while keeping financial concepts serious and meaningful

### Privacy and Family Focus

- Each family operates as an isolated system
- No social features or cross-family comparisons
- Data privacy prioritized for children's information
- Designed for family financial education, not social networking
