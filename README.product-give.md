# Give Category - Charitable Giving & Purposeful Donations

## Philosophy

The Give category teaches children to give purposefully and feel like they're making a meaningful difference for causes they personally care about. Rather than generic giving like tithing, the focus is on helping children develop a **personal connection** to their charitable impact and feel a **locus of control** over how their money directly helps specific causes.

## Learning Objectives

### Primary Goals

- **Purposeful Giving:** Children research and choose causes they personally care about
- **Empathy Development:** Understanding how their money can help others in need
- **Research Skills:** Learning to evaluate different charitable opportunities
- **Impact Awareness:** Seeing direct connection between their donation and results
- **Patience & Planning:** Building up to meaningful donation amounts over time

### Educational Philosophy

- **Personal Connection:** Children must care about the cause, not just give because they're told to
- **Specific Impact:** Focus on targeted causes where they can see direct results
- **Limited Focus:** Maximum 3 causes to encourage depth over breadth
- **Completion Rewards:** Satisfaction of reaching goals and making actual donations

## Core Features ( Implemented)

### Three-Tier Balance System

The Give category displays three distinct amounts to help children understand their giving capacity:

1. **Total Unspent Money** - All Give funds regardless of allocation status
2. **Allocated to Causes** - Money specifically saved for active charitable causes
3. **Unallocated Funds** - Available money that can be allocated to new or existing causes

This system teaches children the difference between having money and having a plan for that money.

### Charitable Causes Management

- **Cause Limit:** Maximum of 3 active causes per recipient
- **Required Information:** Name, description, goal amount, optional due date
- **Visual Progress:** Progress bars showing how much has been allocated toward each goal
- **Status Tracking:** Active, Due Soon, Overdue, and Completed status indicators

### Fund Allocation System

A two-step process that teaches financial planning:

1. **Allocation Phase:** Move unallocated funds to specific causes
   - Interactive allocation modal with validation
   - Visual feedback showing available vs allocated amounts
   - Prevention of over-allocation beyond goal amounts

2. **Donation Phase:** Actually give the money and complete the cause
   - Donation completion modal for final gift
   - Transaction recording when money leaves the Give category
   - Celebration of completed charitable goals

## User Interface Design

### Full-Width Category Layout

- **Category Header:** Give icon with full-width display emphasizing the category's importance
- **Balance Summary:** Three-column display showing total unspent, allocated, and unallocated funds
- **Transaction History:** Right sidebar showing Give-specific transaction history
- **Visual Prominence:** Clean, spacious design that gives appropriate weight to charitable giving

### Interactive Cause Cards

- **Progress Visualization:** Clear progress bars with allocated vs goal amounts
- **Status Badges:** Color-coded indicators (Active, Due Soon, Overdue, Completed)
- **Progressive Action Buttons:**
  - **0% Progress:** Single blue "Give" button (no funds to complete with)
  - **1-99% Progress:** Split button - primary blue "Give" button with dropdown arrow containing "Mark Complete" option
  - **100% Progress:** Single celebratory green "Complete & Donate" button
- **Smart UI Hierarchy:** Design encourages reaching goals before completion while keeping early completion discoverable but secondary
- **Completion Celebration:** Special messaging and visual treatment for completed causes

## System Integration

### Three-Cause Focus System

The system enforces a maximum of 3 active charitable causes per recipient:

- **Application Logic:** Server-side validation prevents creating excessive causes
- **User Experience:** "Add Cause" button is disabled when limit is reached
- **Educational Value:** Forces children to prioritize and focus their giving efforts
- **Progress Management:** Children can only add new causes after completing or removing existing ones

### Fund Flow Architecture

The Give category uses a two-phase system:

1. **Allocation Phase:** Unallocated Give funds are moved to specific charitable causes
2. **Donation Phase:** Allocated funds are "donated" (withdrawn) to complete the charitable gift

This teaches children the difference between having money available and having a specific plan for that money.

## Educational Workflow

### Typical Give Category Journey

1. **Initial Allocation:** Manager distributes allowance funds to Give category
2. **Cause Research:** Child researches and identifies causes they care about
3. **Cause Creation:** Manager helps child add cause with target amount
4. **Fund Allocation:** Regularly allocate unallocated funds toward active causes
5. **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bars show advancement toward goals
6. **Donation Completion:** When ready, complete the donation and celebrate achievement
7. **Impact Reflection:** Discuss the difference their donation will make
8. **New Cycle:** Add new causes and continue the giving journey

### Teaching Opportunities

- **Cause Selection:** Discuss different types of needs and how to evaluate charities
- **Goal Setting:** Help children set realistic but meaningful target amounts
- **Progress Celebration:** Acknowledge milestones on the way to completion
- **Completion Patience:** UI design teaches the value of reaching goals before marking causes complete
- **Planning vs. Completion:** Split button design reinforces the difference between ongoing giving and final donation
- **Impact Discussion:** Talk about how their specific donation will help
- **Gratitude Development:** Appreciation for their ability to help others
