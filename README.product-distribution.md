# Grovesmith Distribution System

## Overview

The distribution system is the core engine of Grovesmith, enabling managers to allocate allowance funds to recipients across the four educational categories (Give, Spend, Save, Invest). It implements a **pooled approach** where undistributed funds accumulate automatically until manually distributed by the manager.

## Key Features

### Pooled Undistributed Funds

- **Automatic Accumulation:** Allowance amounts build up automatically based on recipient age and time since last distribution
- **Flexible Distribution:** Managers distribute when convenient, not on a rigid schedule
- **Bonus Capability:** Managers can add extra funds for special occasions or milestones
- **No Pressure:** System accommodates real family schedules and busy periods

### Interactive Distribution Interface

- **Visual Balance Display:** Clear view of total undistributed funds available
- **Category Allocation Controls:** Interactive +/- buttons and direct input for each category
- **Real-time Validation:** Live feedback prevents over-allocation and shows remaining funds
- **Date Selection:** Calendar picker allows backdating distributions when needed

## Distribution Workflow

```
1. Manager opens distribution modal (always available for testing)
2. System displays current undistributed amount
3. Manager allocates funds across the 4 categories using intuitive controls
4. Manager selects distribution date (defaults to today)
5. Manager confirms distribution with summary review
6. System creates permanent distribution record
7. Database triggers automatically update category balances
8. Individual transactions are recorded for each category
9. UI updates reflect new balances across all views
```

## System Architecture

### Automatic Processing

The distribution system handles complex financial operations automatically:

1. **Balance Updates:** Category balances are updated immediately when distributions are created
2. **Transaction Recording:** Individual transaction records are created for each category allocation
3. **Audit Trail:** Complete historical record is maintained for educational reflection and reporting
4. **Data Validation:** All operations are validated to ensure data integrity and prevent errors

### Security & Privacy

- **Family Isolation:** Each family's data is completely separate and private
- **Manager Control:** Only authenticated managers can access their recipients' data
- **Audit Trail:** All financial operations are tracked for transparency and accountability
- **Error Prevention:** Multiple validation layers prevent data corruption or loss
